Cranium Cafe Exchange Synchronizer


An open source implementation of the Cranium Cafe REST API.  The Exchange Synchronizer polls an Exchange Server on a set interval, pulls only specified users' calendar information and updates the linked Cranium Cafe accounts.

This project has been open sourced to demonstrate the security of the Cranium Cafe REST API and to show that no malicious code was embedded that could bypass Exchange security rules and publish sensitive data.
